# NotThisLemon!
When life gives you lemons but you'll never want a lemon car! Let's prevent that with the help of data science!

-Compare multiple machine learning algorithms.  
-Data cleaning and null removal.  
-Determine whether a feature is important in recognizing lemons(Soon)  
-Use Deep Learning approach for prediction(Soon)
